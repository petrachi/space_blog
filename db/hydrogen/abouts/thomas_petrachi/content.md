I know Thomas Petrachi very well. He first started this blog in early 2014, but what you see now is a complete rebuild of the original application. This Rails application has no models, controllers nor views. Everything is handled in engines and gems. It goes without saying that Thomas loves metaprogramming.

He is the main author on this blog, in his articles, he will share his thoughts about Ruby, Rails and sometimes Javascript. He will also share some links of others people talking about Ruby, Rails and sometimes Javascript, under the 'Ressources' section.

He is also the creator and maintainer of a gem called 'r_kit'. You will find all the documentation available for this very gem here, under the 'Docs' section.

Thomas is currently working as 'lead architect' at Vodeclic, where he first started as a 'web developer intern' in 2011. He was bord south of France, but now lives in Paris.
